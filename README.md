# 12-SQL-Employee-Tracker

This project is an exercise in creating and managing a SQL database through a command-line application built by Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL

The application prompts a main menu with options to View All Departments, View All Roles, View All Employees, Add A Department, Add A Role, Add An Employee, and Update An Employee. Each option asks a series of respective prompts, displays the ultimate result, and returns to the main menu.
